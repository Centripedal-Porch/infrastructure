# Gift/Interactivity

## The HandleBar

For 2024, we will be building and bringing a fully functional bike blender bar,
which will be open for a few hours each day so bar guests can blend their own
mixed drinks.

## Scheduled Events

We’ll be bringing back a few of our most popular events, tandem counseling and
big wheel jousting.

## Unscheduled Events

As part of the HandleBar’s opening hours, we will randomly be hosting smaller
minigames, chosen at random. Events include: bike limbo, foot down, and slowest
race.

For 2024, we will be building and bringing a fully functional bike blender bar,
