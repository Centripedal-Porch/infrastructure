## Time & Effort

### Pre-playa

#### Meetings

There will be one online meeting a month, starting in April just before the Main
Sale. These meetings are a great way to meet your fellow camp members in advance
and find out what projects are ongoing and what you can contribute to.

#### Build Days

##### In Bend

There will be four build days in Bend, one each month from May through August.
The focus of these build days is to primarily build the necessary pieces of
furniture and decor for the Porch. Additional work for infrastructure such as
shade also occurs on these days.

##### Remote

Not in Bend? No problem. We are asking each remote camp member to build and
bring one piece of furniture for the porch. You do not need to know how to do
anything super technical like welding (bonus points if you can), there are a
number of easy weekend project templates we can send you. But helping to build
is required and we want to include our remote campers in the process as much as
possible.

Flying into the event and not able to bring a piece of furniture? Let us know
and we can come up with an alternative way to contribute.

##### On Playa

* Set up
* Shifts (event)
* Strike

##### Post Playa

## Money

### Dues

Burning Man strives to be radically inclusive, but it's also radically
expensive. It's necessary for us all to contribute financially to help cover
these costs which include things like event infrastructure, bar supplies, truck
rentals, and other shared expenses necessary to bring our gift and interactivity
to playa.

We aim to have our dues be lower than similar camps of our size, which is why we
focus on the costs of our interactivity and require camp mates to be more
self-reliant. Once budgets are calculated prior to Main Sale, we share the full
itemized breakdown in the spirit of full transparency.

Estimated dues for 2025 are $300 per person.

Camp dues are non-refundable under any circumstances. We spend this money early
in preparation for each yearâ€™s event, and once it's gone, we can't unbuy things.
You must pay camp dues to reserve your space in camp.

### Deposit

Everyone in camp pays a refundable deposit equal to their dues. To get your
deposit back in full, you must:

* Complete all the shifts and responsibilities you signed up for.
* Fully participate in strike and staying until it's complete.
* Follow the camp rules and be in good standing.

Strike starts at 10:00 AM on Sunday (Temple burn day) and continues until the
truck is loaded, locked, and the final MOOP sweep has been completed. Skipping
strike will forfeit your deposit. Deposits are returned 30 days after the end of
the event. Deposits are refundable if you are unable to attend the event.
